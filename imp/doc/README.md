# typeChecker

A repository full of type checkers for the simply-typed lambda calculus and it's extensions.
The directory imp contains my implementation of System F, complete with lexical analysis and parsing.
The implementation also extends System F with Booleans, Naturals, Recursion, Top and Bottom Types,
Unit, Errors, and Let-Polymorphism.
